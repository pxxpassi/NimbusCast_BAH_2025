# NimbusCast

NimbusCast is a web application that analyzes meteorological data and generates predictive visualizations of cloud and atmospheric phenomena. It leverages AI models to process input data (such as satellite imagery or weather model outputs) and create short video sequences depicting future atmospheric states.

## Proposed Core Features

- **Meteorological Data Analysis:** Processes various forms of weather data.
- **AI-Powered Predictions:** Utilizes AI models to forecast atmospheric changes.
- **Predictive Visualization Generation:** Creates video outputs showing anticipated weather patterns.
- **User Interface:** Provides a web interface for data input and visualization display.

## Style Guidelines
